# Bank-Failures

This project consists of real data from the FDIC, showing banks that failed from 1980 to 2023. It was inspired by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last year. The bank failed due to not anticipating the effect of locking its depositors' money into relatively low-interest-rate securities.

The tools I used for this project are Python and SQLite, along with some additional Python packages for visualizations, but mainly SQLite to showcase my SQL experience.

So far, we have answered a few questions about this data:

1. **How many banks have failed in this dataset?**
   - We found that a total of 3,548 banks have failed.

2. **What are the unique locations where banks have failed?**
   - We found that there are 1,998 unique cities that had bank failures. Out of these unique locations, there were 53 unique states.

3. **What are the top 10 states with bank failures?**
   - We found that Texas had almost a fourth of the bank failures by calculating the cumulative percentage. Here is a visual of the top 10 states:

## This is an ongoing project and will be updated with more queries.
