# Bank-Failures

This project consists of real data from the FDIC, showing banks that failed from 1980 to 2023. It was inspired by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank last year. The bank failed due to not anticipating the effect of locking its depositors' money into relatively low-interest-rate securities.

The tools I used for this project are Python and SQLite, along with some additional Python packages.

So far we have answered a few questions about this data.

1. How many banks have failed in this dataset? We found that there is a total of 3,548 banks that have failed.
2. What are the unique locations where banks have failed? We found that there was 1,998 unique cities that had bank failures. Out of these uniwue locations we found that there was 53 unique states.
3. What was the top 10 states with bank failures? We found that Texas had almost a fourth of the bank failures along by calculation the cumulative percentage. Here is a visual of the top 10 states.

# This is an ongoing project and will be updated with more advanced queries.
